# My Resume

This repository contains my resume created as part of an exercise for the first project in a Web Development Bootcamp. The resume is written in English, although my native language is Brazilian Portuguese.

## Description

I created an index.html file using Visual Studio Code and typed my resume in English. This exercise is part of the requirements for the bootcamp project, and this repository serves as my first GitHub repository.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of HTML and GitHub, as well as to showcase my skills and experience to potential employers or collaborators.

## Getting Started

To view my resume, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. Alternatively, you can visit the GitHub Pages link provided in the repository's description to view the live version online.
